   USB Device Descriptors, for library use when in USB device mode. Descriptors are special
   computer-readable structures which the host requests upon device enumeration, to determine
   the device's capabilities and functions.

   One might think it would be more efficient to just keep descriptors only in flash,
   then copy them out when requested. The LUFA library even has a configuration for that
   and assumes addresses returned point to flash. Problem is, doing that adds about 200
   bytes to the overall flash image. Oh well, best to let sleepin' dogs lie.
