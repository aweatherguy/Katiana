# Run "make help" for target help.
#
# not set here (see Descriptors.c), but VID is 0x14BF and PID is 0x9207
# the boot loader reports this and the sketch will report PID of 0x9208
# so the boot loader shows up on a different COM port than the sketch.
#
# USB hdwr serial numbers are 10 bytes or 20 nibbles, and each nibble
# is encoded as a 16-bit ASCII unicode character. Suggest only hex chars be used.
# See LUFA/Drivers/USB/Core/AVR8/Device_AVR8.h for the function we need to 
# override to implement this. Also see DeviceStandardReq.c function USB_Device_GetInternalSerialDescriptor.
# this is not defined, or called from USB_Device_GetDescriptor based on this macro:
#	!defined(NO_INTERNAL_SERIAL) && (USE_INTERNAL_SERIAL != NO_DESCRIPTOR)
# to insert our own function we must edit DeviceStandardReq.c and modify USB_Device_GetInternalSerialDescriptor
# to call our own serial number extraction function. Easiest thing perhaps is store 20 hex chars in 40 bytes
# of eeprom as unicode and just copy out.
# Summary edits: 
#   Add CUSTOM_USB_SERIAL to LUFAConfig.h
#   DeviceStandardReq.c:    Enable code in two places
#   Device_AVR8.h	    Enable declaration of USB_Device_GetSerialString based on CUSTOM_USB_SERIAL
#			    Remove static inline from declaration.
